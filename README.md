This is like [Invidious](https://invidious.io/) but only for [Ultimate Guitar](https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/).  
Try it out: https://freetar.androidloves.me

## Features
- no ads, popups, just a simple design
- search for tabs and view them
- save your favorite chords as favs (everything is stored in session storage, no account needed)
- dark mode
- auto scroll

## Future work
- ~~show chords~~
